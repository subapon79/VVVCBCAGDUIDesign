<h2>INPUT CONTROLS</h2>

<h3>Introduction to Input Controls</h3>
<p>
Input controls are the interactive user interface elements that allow users to enter,
select, modify or submit data in a system or application.
</p>

<p>
They act as a communication bridge between the user and the system. Input controls
are commonly used in login forms, registration forms, feedback forms, online
applications and search interfaces.
</p>

<p>
A well designed input control improves usability, accessibility, efficiency and
overall user experience whereas poorly designed input controls may lead to user
confusion, input errors and task failure.
</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Good Input Controls</h3>

<h4>1. Clarity</h4>
<p>
The user must clearly understand what type of data is required and how the data
should be entered.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>
Enter Date ❌<br>
Enter Date of Birth (DD/MM/YYYY) ✔
</p>

<h4>2. Consistency</h4>
<p>
Input fields should maintain same alignment, label placement, size and font style
throughout the application. Consistency helps users predict system behaviour.
</p>

<h4>3. Feedback</h4>
<p>
The system should immediately inform the user about correct or incorrect input.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>
Password Accepted ✔<br>
Invalid Email Address ❌
</p>

<h4>4. Simplicity</h4>
<p>
Avoid unnecessary input fields and keep the form simple to improve usability.
</p>

<h4>5. Error Prevention</h4>
<p>
Use dropdown lists, radio buttons and checkboxes instead of open text fields to
minimize user mistakes.
</p>

<h3>Types of Input Controls</h3>

<h4>1. Text Box</h4>
<p>
A text box is used to accept textual data such as name, address, username and
feedback. It allows users to input free form data.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Username</td>
<td>Accepts login name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Address</td>
<td>Accepts location details</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feedback</td>
<td>Accepts suggestions</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Types of Text Box:<br>
• Single Line Text Box<br>
• Multi Line Text Area
</p>

<h4>2. Password Field</h4>
<p>
Password field is used to accept confidential user data such as password or PIN.
The entered characters are masked to protect user privacy.
</p>

Example:<br>
User enters: mypass123<br>
Displayed as: *********

<h4>3. Radio Buttons</h4>
<p>
Radio buttons allow users to select only one option from a list of mutually exclusive
options.
</p>

Example:<br>
Gender:<br>
( ) Male<br>
( ) Female<br>
( ) Other

<h4>4. Checkboxes</h4>
<p>
Checkboxes allow users to select more than one option from the available choices.
</p>

Example:<br>
Select Hobbies:<br>
☑ Reading<br>
☐ Music<br>
☑ Sports<br>
☐ Travelling

<h4>5. Dropdown List</h4>
<p>
Dropdown list provides predefined options from which the user can select one.
It saves space and improves data accuracy.
</p>

Example:<br>
Select Country:<br>
India<br>
USA<br>
UK<br>
Australia

<h4>6. Submit Button</h4>
<p>
Submit button is used to send user data to the server and complete the task such
as login, registration or form submission.
</p>

<h4>7. Reset Button</h4>
<p>
Reset button clears all the entered data and restores default values in the form.
</p>

<h4>8. Date Picker</h4>
<p>
Date picker allows users to select date from calendar instead of typing manually
thereby avoiding format errors.
</p>

<h4>9. File Upload Control</h4>
<p>
File upload control allows users to upload files such as images, documents and
PDFs into the system.
</p>

<h3>Importance of Input Controls in UI/UX Design</h3>
<p>
Input controls help in user interaction, data collection, validation and task
completion. Proper selection and design of input controls improves usability
and ensures smooth interaction between users and digital systems.
