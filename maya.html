<h2>MAYA PRINCIPLE IN UI DESIGN</h2>

<h3>Introduction to MAYA Principle</h3>

<p>
MAYA stands for "Most Advanced Yet Acceptable". It is a design
principle that focuses on creating innovative designs that are
still familiar and acceptable to users.
</p>

<p>
The MAYA principle suggests that users prefer designs that are
new and advanced but not completely unfamiliar. If a design is
too complex or very different from what users already know, it
may lead to confusion and rejection.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, designers should introduce new features gradually
while maintaining familiarity in the interface.
</p>

<h3>Objectives of MAYA Principle</h3>

<ul>
<li>To introduce innovation in design</li>
<li>To maintain user familiarity</li>
<li>To improve usability</li>
<li>To reduce user resistance</li>
<li>To enhance user acceptance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Characteristics of MAYA Principle</h3>

<h4>1. Innovation</h4>
<p>
Design should include new features and improvements.
</p>

<h4>2. Familiarity</h4>
<p>
Interface should maintain elements that users already recognize.
</p>

<h4>3. Balance</h4>
<p>
There should be a balance between advanced design and user comfort.
</p>

<h4>4. User Acceptance</h4>
<p>
Design should be easily accepted by users without confusion.
</p>

<h4>5. Simplicity</h4>
<p>
Innovative features should not increase complexity.
</p>
