<h2>NAVIGATION DESIGN</h2>

<h3>Introduction to Navigation</h3>

<p>
Navigation is an important component of User Interface (UI) design that helps
users to move from one page to another within an application or website.
</p>

<p>
Navigation provides a clear path for users to access information and perform
tasks efficiently. It acts as a roadmap that guides users throughout the system.
</p>

<p>
Proper navigation design improves usability, task completion rate and user
experience whereas poor navigation may confuse users and lead to frustration.
</p>

<h3>Objectives of Navigation Design</h3>

<ul>
<li>To guide users through the system</li>
<li>To provide easy access to information</li>
<li>To reduce user confusion</li>
<li>To improve task efficiency</li>
<li>To enhance overall usability</li>
</ul>

<h3>Characteristics of Good Navigation</h3>

<h4>1. Simplicity</h4>
<p>
Navigation should be simple and easy to understand. Users should not spend
much time figuring out how to move within the system.
</p>

<h4>2. Consistency</h4>
<p>
Navigation structure should remain the same throughout all pages of the
application. This helps users learn the interface quickly.
</p>

<h4>3. Visibility</h4>
<p>
Navigation menus should be clearly visible and easily accessible to users.
Hidden or complex navigation may lead to confusion.
</p>

<h4>4. Feedback</h4>
<p>
Navigation should provide feedback such as highlighting the current page
or active menu item.
</p>

<h4>5. Efficiency</h4>
<p>
Users should be able to reach their desired information with minimum clicks.
</p>

<h3>Types of Navigation</h3>

<h4>1. Menu Based Navigation</h4>
<p>
Menu based navigation provides a list of options from which users can
select the required option.
</p>

Example:
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>About Us</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Contact</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Navigation Bar</h4>
<p>
Navigation bar is usually placed at the top of the page and contains links
to important sections of the application.
</p>

<h4>3. Sidebar Navigation</h4>
<p>
Sidebar navigation is placed on the left or right side of the screen and
contains links to different modules or features.
</p>

<h4>4. Breadcrumb Navigation</h4>
<p>
Breadcrumb navigation shows the user's current location in the application.
</p>

Example:<br>
Home > Products > Electronics > Mobile

<h4>5. Tab Navigation</h4>
<p>
Tab navigation divides the content into different sections and allows users
to switch between them easily.
</p>

<h4>6. Dropdown Navigation</h4>
<p>
Dropdown navigation provides sub options under a main menu option.
</p>

Example:<br>
Services ▼<br>
Web Design<br>
App Development<br>
SEO

<h3>Importance of Navigation in UI/UX Design</h3>

<p>
Navigation plays an important role in improving:
</p>

<ul>
<li>User Interaction</li>
<li>System Usability</li>
<li>Information Accessibility</li>
<li>User Satisfaction</li>
<li>Task Completion Time</li>
</ul>

<p>
Good navigation reduces user errors and improves the overall experience of
the application.
